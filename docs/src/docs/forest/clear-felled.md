## In the Peak District

Visible clear felling/new planting is evident in the larger forestry stands and in isolated locations elsewhere. Almost impossible to locate, for human observers and AI, are young plantings on agricultural and marginal land for ecosystem services (wildlife conservation/watershed management).

Climate change and diseases such as [Phytophthora - Larch Disease](https://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/visiting/frequently-asked-questions/tree-felling-in-the-goyt-valleyphytophera) and [Ash Dieback](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/ilam-park-dovedale-and-the-white-peak/features/tackling-ash-dieback-in-dovedale) means this is a much more common sight in our native trees as well as for forestry practice or the removal of non-native trees for biodiversity improvement.
