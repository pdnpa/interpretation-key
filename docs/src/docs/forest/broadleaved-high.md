The PDNP is notable for its general scarcity of woodlands, with around 8% tree coverage: below the UK woodland coverage of 13% and well below the global average of around 30%

*Note: the National Forest Inventory maps the extent and location of all woodland over 0.5ha in size and at least 20m in width.

While all three NCAs in the PDNP have a scarcity of woodland, there is some variation in the extent and type of tree cover. Woodland coverage is around 10% in the Dark Peak, 8% in the South West Peak and 6% in the White Peak. There is less coniferous woodland in the White Peak than the Dark or South West Peak. According to Natural England figures, only 1% of the PDNP is covered by ancient woodland; 1,417ha is ancient and semi-natural woodland and 689ha is plantation on ancient woodland.
