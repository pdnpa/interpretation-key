Sub-categories are identified on the basis of **D2b Upland grass moor** which may include Festuca spp., Agrostis spp., Molinia caerulea, and Nardus stricta. and **D2d Upland grass moor on blanket bog/peat soil** overlying a peat substrate, usually found on plateaux, dominated by cotton-grass (Eriophorum angustifolium). Areas are in general unenclosed for the purpose of controlling livestock grazing although property boundaries around large areas may be present.

D2b and D2d are identified and selected by [Peaty Soils Location (England)](https://naturalengland-defra.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1e5a1cdb2ab64b1a94852fb982c42b52_0/explore?location=52.763272%2C-2.506216%2C8.29)
