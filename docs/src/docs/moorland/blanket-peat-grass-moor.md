## Definition of landscape category

D2 Upland grass moor - Unenclosed upland areas with greater than 80% cover of grass species.

Sub-categories are identified on the basis of **D2b Upland grass moor** which may include Festuca spp., Agrostis spp., Molinia caerulea, and Nardus stricta. and **D2d Upland grass moor on blanket bog/peat soil** overlying a peat substrate, usually found on plateaux, dominated by cotton-grass (Eriophorum angustifolium). Areas are in general unenclosed for the purpose of controlling livestock grazing although property boundaries around large areas may be present.

D2b and D2d are identified and selected by [Peaty Soils Location (England)](https://naturalengland-defra.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1e5a1cdb2ab64b1a94852fb982c42b52_0/explore?location=52.763272%2C-2.506216%2C8.29)

## In the Peak District

Upland acid grassland (D2) are, as with all D classes, common plagioclimax communities in the PDNP. Habitats that include a wide range of grassland types within them often forming patchy/fragmented mosaics with other wet/dry acid vegetation communities and scrub. It includes upland acid grassland (unenclosed) and lowland acid grassland (enclosed) often forming a continuum with acid influenced E2b rough pasture and F3d wet grassland and rush pasture. Along with these extensive upland acid grassland fringes D2 is a component of extended mosaics with all of the heathland and blanket bog vegetation classes in the PDNP and is found on nutrient poor soils. These are either wet, D2d, or free draining, D2b, with an acidic pH range of 4 to 5.5. D2b occurs on top of insoluble rocks or superficial deposits such as sands, gravels and thin peat. In the PDNP, these conditions are often found on the clough (valley) sides or below the edges of many of the heathlands and blanket bogs. D2d is analogous with grass and sedge dominated blanket bog.
