## Definition of landscape category

DI Upland heath - Areas with greater than 80% cover of heather (Calluna vulgaris and Erica spp) and/or Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) species.

Characteristically found on acid heathland soils, steep rocky hillsides and crags, and peat-covered moorlands it may be burned in patches or strips for grouse moor. Areas which have been burnt, but which it can be assumed will regenerate as heath, are included.

D1a and D1b are identified and selected by [Peaty Soils Location (England)](https://naturalengland-defra.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1e5a1cdb2ab64b1a94852fb982c42b52_0/explore?location=52.763272%2C-2.506216%2C8.29)

## In the Peak District
Upland heath, away from specific environmental conditions, is a habitat created and maintained by some form of management (an anthropogenic plagioclimax community) often over 1000’s of years. It is found on wet acidic and nutrient poor soils - usually on shallow peat or low nutrient content podzolised soils. Heather dominated moorland is a common plagioclimax community in the PDNP, partly as a result of management for red grouse shooting. Grouse moor management in the form of rotational burning keeps heather in it’s fast growing ‘pioneer; and ‘building’ phases as the dominant vegetation in large swathes of upland heathland. IN other areas bilberry can dominate as well as form co-dominant stands with heather.  D1 is also a key component of the large areas of semi natural upland moorland mosaics.
