## Definition of landscape category

D4 Unenclosed lowland areas - Lowland areas which are not enclosed for stock control purposes.

Two sub-categories are identified: **D4a Rough grassland - unenclosed lowland areas** dominated by grass species and **D4b Heath - unenclosed lowland** areas dominated by mixed heath species e.g. gorse (Ulex spp). Both sub-categories are likely to contain some scattered trees, rushes and bracken, and may be grazed. D4 categories occur on land with elevation that is equal to or below that of the surrounding E categories.
