## Aerial Definition



## In the Peak District
The habitats considered for this assessment fall into two main categories. Firstly, areas of moorland dominated by purple moor-grass â€“ often blanket bog or heath which has been invaded as a result of regular burning over wet soils. Much less extensive however is rush pasture. Occurring on wet and infertile soils, it contains a mixture of grasses (including purple moor-grass), sedges, rushes and also some broadleaved species. Wet grassland and rush pasture covers approximately 1,550 hectares in the PDNP, with 250 ha considered priority habitat. These, often marginal, habitats are important for invertebrate species, several bird species, amphibians and reptiles.
