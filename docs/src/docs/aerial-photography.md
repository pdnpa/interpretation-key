# Aerial Photography

Figure 1 shows the capture dates for the imagery used in this exercise. Weather affects both when imagery can be collected light effects due to time of day, seasonal timings affect the quality of imagery in terms of sunlight intensity and angle. In an ideal situation, where resources permit, photography used in a survey like this one would be from one survey event. In practice we have had to use imagery collected over 4 years. Whilst not an unusual situation with aerial imagery this presents a number of challenges to any surveyor in identifying and separating vegetation at landscape scales.

As can be seen from figure 1 the imagery used here was collected over 4 years, in UK terms, from the middle of meteorological spring to early summer. Surveying plants during spring into summer across large landscapes presents us with a large range in phenological changes to vegetation, such as flowering, leaf setting, leaf development and how green they look (chlorophyll content). Alongside this most of the Landscape is actively managed so agricultural management such as fertiliser spreading, livestock movements and grass cutting for fodder can radically alter the appearance and growth stage of vegetation and confound classification. 

Figure 2 illustrates some of the large differences in the general appearance of vegetation appearance in our imagery set. Please also see the landcover sections below for particular challenges associated with each subclass.
