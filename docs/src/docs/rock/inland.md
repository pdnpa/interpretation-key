## Definition of landscape category

G2 Bare rock - any significant areas of bare rocks, such as scree, cliffs and limestone pavements. Only planimetric area is mapped, so large but near vertical cliffs may cover a small area when mapped, or even be missed. The category is divided into **G2a when the bare rock is inland** and **G2b when it is sea cliffs or rock exposed to coastal** erosion.
