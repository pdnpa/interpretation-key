## Definition of landscape category

G3 Other coastal features - The category includes: **G3a Dunes (bare or vegetated with coastal grasses)**, **G3b Sand beach**, **G3c Shingle beach** and **G3d Mudflats**. These may not be mapped if photography coincides with high tide. As in the case of category F1, the solution will be to map areas visible on the photography and to subsequently interpret changes with caution depending on the tidal state of the two sets of photography.
