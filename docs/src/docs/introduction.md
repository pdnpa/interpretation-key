Land Cover are the physical elements occupying the earth's surface. This is important data for [Category 5](https://www.iucn.org/resources/publication/management-guidelines-iucn-category-v-protected-areas-protected) protected landscapes to monitor. Human activity, mostly for food production and forestry, is transforming landscapes. Today, one third of all land is degraded or degrading, which harms biodiversity and jeopardises essential ecosystem services such as carbon storage. Protected areas offer a solution. If effectively managed and fairly governed, such areas can safeguard nature and cultural resources, protect human health and well-being, provide sustainable livelihoods and so support sustainable development (IUCN).

Survey, monitoring and evaluation is crucial to understanding the condition and management status (getting better, staying the same, getting worse) of any protected area, site, habitat or species. Due to restricted budgets and short-term priorities it is often the poor cousin to physical projects. Therefore, the last time land cover and land use were monitored to a high degree of accuracy and detail in UK National Parks was 1991. This study (seen below) assessed point, linear and polygon features across 50 types of landscape features.

This is an interpretation key for the polygon features only which make up 38 definitions of Land Cover.

## Landscape Change in National Parks (CCP359)

This 1991 Countryside Commission report published the results of monitoring of landscape change in National Parks in England and Wales. The project compared aerial photography of each National Park from dates in the 1970s with the late 1980s. This enabled an assessment to be made of change in land cover, as well as linear and point landscape features. Both net change (overall loss or gain) and gross change (which measures change between features) are assessed, with ground surveys carried out to check the accuracy of the interpretation of the aerial photos. Summaries of the changes, supported by maps and bar charts, are given for each National Park in England and Wales, including the Broads Authority. The report concludes with a discussion on the common themes and their scale and significance for our cherished landscapes.
