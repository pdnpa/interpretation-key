E2 Grassland - Areas which show evidence of being enclosed for stock control purposes. Two sub-categories are identified:

**E2b Rough pasture** - enclosed areas subject to little or no management. Characterised by a high density of native grasses and often containing invasive species such as bracken, bramble, thistle, rushes and scattered trees. Tussocks may also be in evidence. Generally occurs on steep slopes, poorly drained sites and on soils of low fertility. Frequently includes areas that can be accessed by farm machinery indicating that it may have been managed in the past.
