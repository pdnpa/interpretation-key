## Definition of landscape category

E2 Grassland - Areas which show evidence of being enclosed for stock control purposes. 

**E2a Improved pasture** - grassland that is intensively managed for grazing and/or fodder production. Characterised by signi1icantly modified swards produced by the use of fertilisers, herbicides, drainage and/or occasional reseeding. Species such as rushes, thistles and bracken are normally eradicated but could be present in small quantities. However, daisies, buttercups, etc. may be present. It does not cover grass leys and generally occurs within the limits of mechanical operations. The sward may be lumpy due to uneven fertilisation from cow pats, and may have artificial boundaries caused by strip grazing. From spring to late summer cutting for hay or silage may occur.

## In the Peak District
The PDNP is roughly 50% grassland, making grasslands its main habitat. However, most grassland has been agriculturally improved (an estimated 72% of the total grassland habitats). Such management removes most broad-leaved plants, furthers dominance by grasses and produces a poor environment for wildlife. This is in line with global trends, with temperate grasslands being considered the most altered terrestrial ecosystem on the planet. This is one of the most variable classes in the imagery as the closely reflect past and recent management (see SK1776 for examples of the variation).
